    <p>
      Hi everyone, I'm Connie! 
      <br></br>
      I'm currently a senior at Rutgers majoring in Aerospace Engineering with a double major in Professional Physics. 
      I am fascinated by all feats of engineering and science, from obvious ones like rocket launches and spacecraft, 
      to more daily ones, like how 
      <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/207607" target=_blank>people will eat more M&Ms if there's more colors</a>.

      <br></br>

      But specifically, I am passionate about exploring the universe we live in. Whether that exploration comes in the form of
      discovering fundamental laws of physics that govern our creation, or creating spacecraft to search for clues about 
      the formation of life, I want to learn how the world works, and hopefully contribute to our discoveries in the future. Maybe we'll
      even find some friends in this barren universe :) (top ten anime crossovers?).

      <br></br>

      As I navigate the worlds of engineering and physics, I've had the awesome chance to do a few things that might be 
      cool:
        <ul id = "about-list">
          <li>Bringing CubeSats to Rutgers with <a href="https://www.laurentburlion.com/" target=_blank>Prof. Burlion</a> 
            and <a href="http://star.physics.rutgers.edu/">STAR </a>. (We got accepted into the 
            <a href="https://www.afrl.af.mil/News/Article/2852221/afrl-selects-10-universities-for-prestigious-satellite-program/" target=_blank>UNP Program</a>!!!)</li>

          <li>
            Interning with the <a href=https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/>SpaceX</a> Fairing Refurb team at the Cape
          </li>

          <li>Doing a co-op as a Pathways Intern in fall 2019 at NASA GSFC working in the 
            <a href="https://etd.gsfc.nasa.gov/560/code563.php " target=_blank>Power Systems</a> branch, and summer/part-time work with the 
            <a href="https://etd.gsfc.nasa.gov/590/code597.php" target=_blank>Propulsion</a> branch
          </li>
          
          <li>Embracing communities and mentorship with 
            <a href="https://teatime.substack.com/about" target=_blank>Tea Time</a>
            and <a href="https://soe.rutgers.edu/ambassadors" target=_blank>SoE Ambassador</a> </li>
        </ul>
      In my spare time, I love to draw! I've been drawing digitally since 2012, and you can find more of my artwork 
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/conwolf.art/" target=_blank>here :)!</a> I am also a huge fan of these things: 
      rock climbing, playing the violin, my cat <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ponyo.cat/" target=_blank>Ponyo</a>, weightlifting very occasionally, and K-indie. 
      <br></br>
      Thanks for dropping by! Hope you enjoy your stay!

            Worked in Cape Canaveral, FL figuring out how to clean, weigh, fix, and throw away <a href=https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/>fairings</a>! 
            This was the first in-person internship
            I've had in a while and it was awesome doing cool things like watching a rocket land and doing mock astronaul training with the Inspiration4 nurses :)

            I also did important things like create a tier list of our grab-n-go lunches (the poke bowls won)

          <p>Started bringing to life Rutgers' first CubeSat mission proposal from scratch, 
            centered around testing <a href="https://www.laurentburlion.com/" target=_blank>Prof. Burlion's</a> 
            propellant slosh-oriented control algorithms for the 
            <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/home/CubeSats_initiative" target=_blank>NASA CSLI</a>! <br></br>
            Onboarded over 20 members for three subsystem teams, lead the Systems team through proposal writing, 
            and collaborating with Prof. Burlion's lab.
            <br></br>
            Honestly a pretty dope experience, learned what it's like to lead a large team who is depending on you, 
            also learned how hard it is to come up with an acronym for a mission :(

          <p>Due to COVID, incoming Rutgers engineering students were encouraged to participate in bi-weekly summer squads to
            help introduce them to the college environment and provide training for course registration etc. I got to lead two 
            squads of 15-20 students and teach them about all things college! From hosting game nights, to teaching them how
            to navigate the registration websites, I served as a mentor answering any questions they had regarding college 
            lifestyle and transitioning from high school. 
            <br></br>

            <br></br>
            I learned a ton about speaking confidently in front of 100+ students, also talked to some kids about how cool engineering is :)
            At some point, also convinced people that Iron Man is representative of all of the engineering departments at Rutgers.

            Came back in the summer to work on looking into 
            <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/consortium/ModelBasedSystems" target=_blank>Model Based Systems Engineering</a> 
            for the propulsion branch, and learning how to model the 
            <a href="https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/"target=_blank>Roman Space Telescope</a> 
            propulsion system in MagicDraw. I modeled the structural and behavioral
            aspects of the system, and gave a presentation to my branch at the end of my rotation about MBSE applications. I also
            got to do CFD simulations in STAR-CCM+ modeling sloshing fluids in cylindrical tanks. 
            <br></br>
            I also was the PAXC center chair, helping to organize events for interns!
            <br></br>
            Because of COVID, this was done remotely. I got to eat lunch with people in front of my camera, though!

            Joined STAR the same time I started working with Prof. Burlion. Revived the CubeSat club and started making
            strides towards making a team of motivated CubeSat engineers. I started with a weather balloon project,
            which got cancelled due to COVID, but instead led a team of 4 students to develop a Python-based thermal simulation,
            similar to SatTherm. 
            <br></br>
            Found out that someone sent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8W-auqg024">garlic bread to space</a> on a weather balloon, 
            might be a stretch goal for us.

            Joined Prof. Burlion's lab looking to get into spacecraft controls, and looking for an advisor to build a CubeSat
            program at Rutgers! I really wanted to get space industry experience to students at Rutgers, and Prof. Burlion has 
            really cool research to put on a CubeSat. 
            <br></br>
            Got to also design an experiment/summer project for another student funded by the NJSGC!

           Dove into the space industry with a half year co-op, working on a user-friendly power balance analysis tool in Python,
           learning about high-voltage circuitry on the <a href="https://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/" target = _blank>Dragonfly Mass Spectrometer</a>, 
           and doing some LabView programming for branch activities. I also presented my work at the Rutgers Interns Present competition!

           <br></br>
           The crab cakes were also really good, and I got to go to the Interational Astronautical Conference!

            Started off my research career with <a href="https://hmnl.rutgers.edu/" target=_blank>Prof. Singer</a> looking at methods of
            growing zinc oxide nanostructures to improve adhesion between copper and thermoset plastics. I also got to
            shadow a grad student using the scanning electron microscope and do some X-ray diffraction analysis. 
            <br></br>
            Had a lot of fun looking at little hexagons under a microscope, and was funded by the NJSGC!

            And thus, began my journey into the neverending rabbithole of meeting cool people, 
            learning cool things, and learning cool things from cool people. 
            <br></br>
            I joined some clubs like AIAA and Society of Physics Students and did some cool programming projects with
            localization alorithms, launching an L1 certification model rocket, and learning more about physics!
