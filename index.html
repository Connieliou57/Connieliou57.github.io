    <p>
      Hi everyone, I'm Connie! 
      <br></br>
      I'm currently a junior at Rutgers majoring in Aerospace Engineering with a minor (but maybe double major) in Physics. 
      I am fascinated by all feats of engineering and science, from obvious ones like rocket launches and spacecraft, 
      to more daily ones, like how 
      <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/207607" target=_blank>people will eat more M&Ms if there's more colors</a>.
      <br></br>
      But specifically, I am passionate about exploring the universe we live in. Whether that exploration comes in the form of
      discovering fundamental laws of physics that govern our creation, or creating spacecraft to search for clues about 
      the formation of life, I want to learn how the world works, and hopefully contribute to our discoveries in the future. 
      <br></br>
      As I slowly navigate the worlds of engineering and physics, I've had the awesome chance to do a few things that might be 
      cool:
        <ul id = "about-list">
          <li>Doing a co-op as a Pathways Intern in fall 2019 at NASA GSFC working in the 
            <a href="https://etd.gsfc.nasa.gov/560/code563.php">Power Systems</a> branch, and have since 
            returned for the following summer and fall semesters in the 
            <a href="https://etd.gsfc.nasa.gov/590/code597.php">Propulsion</a> and 
            <a href="https://etd.gsfc.nasa.gov/590/code595.php">Flight Dynamics</a> branches
          </li>
          <li>Working with <a href="https://www.laurentburlion.com/" target=_blank>Prof. Burlion</a> 
            and <a href="http://star.physics.rutgers.edu/">STAR </a>to develop Rutgers' first CubeSat Proposal</li>
          <li>Embracing communities and mentorship with 
            <a href="https://teatime.substack.com/about" target=_blank>Tea Time</a>
            and <a href="https://soe.rutgers.edu/ambassadors" target=_blank>SoE Ambassador</a> </li>
        </ul>
      In my spare time, I love to draw! I've been drawing digitally since 2012, and you can find more of my artwork 
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/conwolf.art/" target=_blank>here :)!</a> I am also a huge fan of these things: 
      hiking, musicals, playing the violin, forever scrolling through Petfinder and wishing to adopt a cat, and K-indie. 
      <br></br>
      Thanks for dropping by! Hope you enjoy your stay!

            Onboarded over 20 members for three subsystem teams, lead the Systems team through proposal writing, 
            and collaborating with Prof. Burlion's lab.
            <br></br>
            Honestly a pretty dope experience, learned what it's like to lead a large team who is depending on you, 
            also learned how hard it is to come up with an acronym for a mission :(

            I also am working on the Tour Engagement Committee to create new virtual tour plans for the engineering school,

            <br></br>
            I learned a ton about speaking confidently in front of 100+ students, also talked to some kids about how cool engineering is :)
            At some point, also convinced people that Iron Man is representative of all of the engineering departments at Rutgers.

            Came back in the summer to work on looking into 
            <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/consortium/ModelBasedSystems" target=_blank>Model Based Systems Engineering</a> 
            for the propulsion branch, and learning how to model the 
            <a href="https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/"target=_blank>Roman Space Telescope</a> 
            propulsion system in MagicDraw. I modeled the structural and behavioral
            aspects of the system, and gave a presentation to my branch at the end of my rotation about MBSE applications. I also
            got to do CFD simulations in STAR-CCM+ modeling sloshing fluids in cylindrical tanks. 
            <br></br>
            I also was the PAXC center chair, helping to organize events for interns!
            <br></br>
            Because of COVID, this was done remotely. I got to eat lunch with people in front of my camera, though!

            Joined STAR the same time I started working with Prof. Burlion. Revived the CubeSat club and started making
            strides towards making a team of motivated CubeSat engineers. I started with a weather balloon project,
            which got cancelled due to COVID, but instead led a team of 4 students to develop a Python-based thermal simulation,
            similar to SatTherm. 
            <br></br>
            Found out that someone sent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8W-auqg024">garlic bread to space</a> on a weather balloon, 
            might be a stretch goal for us.

            Joined Prof. Burlion's lab looking to get into spacecraft controls, and looking for an advisor to build a CubeSat
            program at Rutgers! I really wanted to get space industry experience to students at Rutgers, and Prof. Burlion has 
            really cool research to put on a CubeSat. 
            <br></br>
            Got to also design an experiment/summer project for another student funded by the NJSGC!

            And thus, began my journey into the neverending rabbithole of meeting cool people, 
            learning cool things, and learning cool things from cool people. 
            <br></br>
            I joined some clubs like AIAA and Society of Physics Students and did some cool programming projects with
            localization alorithms, launching an L1 certification model rocket, and learning more about physics!
